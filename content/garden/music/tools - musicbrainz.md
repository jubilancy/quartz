## MusicBrainz Editing tools

### User scripts / GreaseMonkey / User javascripts / UserJS

Userscripts run in a users web browser and make on-the-fly local changes to specific web pages. In MusicBrainz they are generally used to change the display of pages, often facilitating editing.

For instance, a script may add functionalities to a MusicBrainz page, or shorten repetitive actions to only one click, and so on.

[Release Editor Seeding](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release_Editor_Seeding): Providing programmatic information to the release editor (from another site or an application), the closest we have to an edit API as yet

[Server setup](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Server_Setup)

The [MusicBrainz Server](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Server) is not available as an executable application. Setting up the server will require you to checkout the source code and follow the INSTALL file's instructions.

The [MusicBrainz Database](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) contains all the metadata information available on musicbrainz.org and it's free for anyone to [download](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Download) and make use of it (and we encourage this!). Setting it up will require access to a PostgreSQL database. See instructions from [server setup](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Server_Setup) or use third-party [\[1\]](https://pypi.org/project/mbdata/).

[Server environment variables that may prove useful](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/MusicBrainz_Server_Environment_Variables)

[Search Server Setup](https://github.com/metabrainz/mb-solr) and [Search Indexer Setup](https://github.com/metabrainz/sir) if you're brave enough to want to try.

Embedded metadata

[Picard Tag Mapping](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs/mappings/): The documentation for how [Picard](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Picard) maps concepts to tags; useful if you want to use these tags elsewhere, or if you'd like to follow the same standard.

Communicating with other developers

[IRC](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/IRC): Here's where you ask questions of real live people, if anyone's awake. You love it, you know it.

[Forum](https://community.metabrainz.org/): And here's where you ask if we aren't awake, or for anything style-related or needing more consideration than can be easily given in IRC.

[MusicBrainz Summits](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Summit): These happen occasionally, and people get together and talk about MusicBrainz. You should consider coming! Even if not, the discussions had here are sometimes important, and might be worth perusing.
